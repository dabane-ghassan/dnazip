###### [UNDER DEVELOPEMENT] This project is a part of the algorithms and data structures course in my master's degree and it's currently being worked on with the help of this [youtube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJOShNabSl-qsp5-D-WJe0Dk9nIE5aPC1) (((***because there's nothing better than projecting advanced data structures inside the cerebral cortex with some metal***)))

A Python implementation of The Burros-Wheeler Transform (BWT) alongside Huffman compression on DNA sequences.

Current workflow : to be continued...

## TODO :
- Continue working on the TODO list.
